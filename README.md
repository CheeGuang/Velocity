## Idea For Assignment II

The idea for my Assignment 1 is to create a Full Stack Website for an Official NIKE Reseller.

### External User’s Goal:

This site’s target audience are teenagers, young adults and potential NIKE customers who wishes to get their hands on a brand new NIKE Shoe.

### Site Owner’s goal:

Velocity would like to have an interactive and user-friendly website that allow them to have a smooth experience buying a new shoe.
Additionally, the Velocity wishes to expand their number of Members in order to boost sales.

## Design Process:

<!-- As a user, I would like to use the KFC website on split screen, however, certain pages in the official KFC website is not responsive and i struggle navigating the website (E.g. Home Page and Menu Page are Not responsive). Hence I decided to make my KFC website responsive

As a user, I want the website to remember my cart even after I close my browser, so I decided to utilise local storage to store cart details.

As a user, I want to see a consistent use of color and design in the KFC Website. Thus, I decided to incorporate KFC's signature "Pigment Red" colour into every page. -->
