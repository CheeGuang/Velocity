## Idea For Assignment II

For Assignment 2, we decided to explore building an interactive e-commerce web application complete with sutiable gamification concepts and API calls. Our e-commerce website client is Velocity, an Official NIKE Retailer.

### Target Market

Average Website Visitor:

- From 18 years old
- Capable of making online purchases
- NIKE enthusiasts who lives in Singapore
- Busy work-life and prefers shopping online

### Site Ownerâ€™s Objectives and Goals

Velocity would like to be able to promote online presence and brand recognition through web branding. As a NIKE shoe retailer, they hope to have a website that is associated with being active, full of energy while maintaining a professional front. Velocity also aims to attract and retain more members to boost brand loyalty.

## Design Process

Taking into account Velocity's requirements, our proposed design aims to incoporate the following:

### Look and Feel

- Visual hierarchy: Using whitespace, font (size and color) and a simple layout to present content to users in clear and concise manner.

The primary colours that are used in the website is:

- Shades of Light Grey
- Black
- Yellow
- Orange

This is to enhance Velocity's brand image as a clean and minimal to bring the focus to the shoes. Bright and attention-grabbing colours, yellow and orange incites positive and empowering traits like energy, active and freshness.

### Gamifying the Experience

- To encourage membership signups, Members' Privilege includes:
  - Exclusive designs for members only
  - Earn and redeem points for cash rebates
  - More cashbacks on birthday months
  - Flash deals
- To entice and motivate customers, a progress bar is used as a visual aid to indicate how much more a customer should purchase to qualify for free shipping.
- Shoe Finder Quiz aims to deliver a more customised shopping experience by reccommending the most suitable shoe according to customer's answer.
