## Idea For Assignment II

For Assignment 2, we decided to explore building an interactive e-commerce web application complete with sutiable gamification concepts and API calls. Our e-commerce website is Velocity, an Official NIKE Reseller.

### Target Market

Average Website Visitor:

- From 18 years old
- Capable of making online purchases
- NIKE patrons who lives in Singapore due to shipping limitations
- Busy work-life and prefers shopping online

### Site Ownerâ€™s Objectives and Goals

Velocity would like to be able to promote online presence and brand recognition through web branding. As a NIKE shoe reseller, they hope to have a website that is associated with being active, full of energy while maintaining a professional front. Velocity also aims to attract and retain more members to boost brand loyalty.

## Design Process

After reviewing, our proposed design aims to address the following:

1. Visual hierarchy: Using whitespace, font (size and color) and different layout to present content to users in clear and concise manner.
2. Member's Privilege: Members have access to selected shoes only and can redeem points to exchange for rebates.
3. Call-to-Action: Using black and orange against a white background to highlight important information, catch users' attention and guide them through the shopping process.

The primary colours that are used in the website is:

- Shades of Light Grey
- Black
- Yellow
- Orange

This is to enhance Velocity's brand image as an elegant, clean and minimal website while using bright and attention-grabbing colours, yellow and orange to incite positive and empowering traits like energy, active and freshness.

## User Stories

- As a first-time

<!-- As a user, I would like to use the KFC website on split screen, however, certain pages in the official KFC website is not responsive and i struggle navigating the website (E.g. Home Page and Menu Page are Not responsive). Hence I decided to make my KFC website responsive

As a user, I want the website to remember my cart even after I close my browser, so I decided to utilise local storage to store cart details.

As a user, I want to see a consistent use of color and design in the KFC Website. Thus, I decided to incorporate KFC's signature "Pigment Red" colour into every page. -->
